You will receive a JSON payload describing a Playwright UI test run.

TASK
- Read the payload carefully.
- Write a short, human-friendly SUMMARY (<= 3 lines).
- For each failed test case, assign a LABEL and a brief REASON:
  - label: "transient" OR "real"
  - reason: <= 160 chars, cite evidence from message/details
- Be conservative: if unclear, default to "real".

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY)
{
  "summary": "string",
  "labels": [
    {"name": "string", "label": "transient" | "real", "reason": "string"}
  ]
}

DO NOT return anything except a single valid JSON object (no markdown, no extra keys).
